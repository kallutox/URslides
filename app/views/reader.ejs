                your
                website. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than
                me,
                believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your
                website’s
                Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. We have so many things
                that we
                have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. Lorem Ipsum best not make any more threats
                to
                your website. It will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. Look at these words.
                Are
                they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I
                guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.</p>
